      beginning of sep: i move in and did math orientation (was a bunch of bs but worth going to ig). classes start and it was hella light at first. i had so much time to meet new people and make projects.
      v1 life is definitely vibrant‚Äîi thought that i got unlucky when i didn't get mkv, uwp, or cmh, but v1 is definitely optimal for cs. its very close to pac and i found that 90% of my cs friends got assigned here.

      when quizzes came around, workload started picking up, but its still much easier than eng. although the assignments & studying defo started taking more time ( i didn't take any of the 14's, and for most of my homies who did; they took days on the first assignments then later dropped the classes üò≠). side project wise, i worked alot on phuture (phutureai.com) and started making reels 
      (deadass nothing better to do in waterloo), i also built trivalguessr (trivialguessr.com) in under a week + went to hack the north for the first time.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      side note: friends in eng (especially ce) are like 2 weeks in but 3 weeks behind already üòÇ.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      i definitely missed out on waterloo tech week, i was too into my projects that i didn't consider it, but looking back i regret it. tip: go to these events.
      i'm 100% going to socratica and visiting akatos house waterloo in the upcoming weeks though, excited.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      studying in dc/dp every day has been a weird highlight, something that sounds so mundane creates hella memories. everyone being in the dc basement drinking ice capps + being 'locked in' tryna find each other after the quiz scores get released is actually hilarious ‚ò†Ô∏è.

    <h5>
      i got friends flying to sf soon and homies who got interest from yc. 3 weeks in ‚Äî the uw ecosystem is going strong. surround yourself with people who share your ambitions and push you to be better. find individuals who are respectfully honest, even if that means disagreeing with your ideas
      and critiquing your projects right in front of your face. these people are rare these days. 
      
      message me on any medium if you want to discuss anything, im down to help. james out ‚úåüèª.
