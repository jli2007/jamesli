<h5>main takeaways: the selection for uw programs feel extremely random and depend very heavily on the reputation of the high school you attend (all the responses listed are from my school ‚Äî one of the top feeder schools for uw). many people who have submitted lesser polished aifs have gotten accepted during earlier rounds than those who spent months planning and writing it. my best advice is to focus more on answering the question directly and simply rather than storytelling with creative writing (i did this and i spent way longer on my aif than needed‚Äîlesser polished ones from peers achieved similar results)</h5>

My life oscillates between elegance and ambition. Soccer provides a balance. Although I have captained my rep squad and played a pivotal role for my school team, its influence on me extends far beyond my success on the field. 

The sport has laid my foundations since the age of five. The fluidity in ball techniques and my drive to perfect them has always been a benchmark for my various pursuits. As the NeoDev League grew to 100 participants with $12k in funding, I strived to develop a flawless event. 

Soccer also symbolizes my peace. In times of adversity, my basement becomes my personal sanctuary. I often lock myself in the darkness‚Äîjust me and the ball. It's my way of coping, of embracing pressure. 

At UW, every challenge will be approached with the fiery composure that soccer instilled in me. I will always carry a ball in my backpack‚Äîan elegant reminder of the sport that balances my life.

I recently led the first iteration of the NeoDev League, a programming competition that empowered 100+ high school students from across the Waterloo region to turn tech dreams into reality. I mainly led the website development, sponsor outreach, and policies. 

As a hackathon fanatic, I identified many flaws in the typical experience. There was a lack of competitive spirit and the format felt uninspiring. I set out to fill these gaps with NeoDev. 

I united with a team of changemakers, and together, we pioneered an exciting initiative. At NeoDev, squads were formed by school, sparking natural rivalries. Team sizes were also increased to simulate the industry, drawing inspiration from my internship at Lakes Software. 

With support from the WRDSB, Convictional, and Den1880, I steered a tide-shifting initiative that raised $12k in funding, enabling NeoDev to create waves in the Waterloo region.

As I introduced myself on my first day at Lakes Software, I felt dozens of eyes piercing into my back. The senior developers whom I had always looked up to made me feel like an outsider. 

During my first weeks, my assignments were underwhelming. I fiddled with tasks off the backlog that felt purposeless. Interactions felt cold‚Äîthe lack of trust was in the air. My initial treatment proved to be a testament to the status quo where age often dictates capability. 

As time passed, my endless pursuit of knowledge became noticed. Posing boundless questions and swiftly completing duties released the constraints placed upon me. I gradually earned my way into the company roadmap and experienced the most rewarding summer of my life. 

Looking back, I should‚Äôve bet on my abilities. I shouldn‚Äôt have accepted uninspiring chores. In the office, I‚Äôm not an ordinary student anymore, but a software developer.
#
<h4>Question 4: What is your primary goal for attending the University of Waterloo? Have you explored, been exposed to, or have experience in the field you plan to pursue and if so, how? Did you turn to anyone for advice in exploring alternative options or backup plans for your goal and if so, how did this person help you? (900-character limit)</h4>
#
At UW, I aim to maximize every moment. I learned the hard way that time is free, yet somehow priceless. Growing up, I believed that success would be handed to me‚Äîmy reliance on privilege cost me countless opportunities. 

In 11th grade, while discussing backup plans with my parents, I realized I didn‚Äôt even have a primary goal. The conversation woke me up to reality, igniting my obsession with self-improvement and valuing time more effectively. I soon discovered a passion for technology, slowly gaining experience through my internships at Tauria & Lakes Software, leading NeoDev, and in my hackathon successes. 

I will continue to capitalize on every occasion at UW‚Äîthe leader in opening doors. With its stellar reputation in co-op and tech programs, UW offers endless possibilities for me to expand my horizons. Time waits for nobody, but now that I learned to spend it wisely, I feel limitless.

Each time I throw a leg over my bike, I enter a world of adventure. I first started mountain biking during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to stay active, explore my local forest and relax my mind. Over time, it's grown into much more than a hobby‚Äîit taught me valuable life lessons: the ruggedness of the terrain I ride exposes my resilience; each improved lap time reveals my ability to assess risks and push through uneasy situations. I‚Äôve also been led to connect with those who share my love for bikes, developing mutual encouragement as we push each other to achieve our goals. These connections even led me to a part-time job in sales at a local bike shop, where I‚Äôve reinforced my communication skills and learned the value of building a close network. At Waterloo, I will apply these lessons by balancing academics with extracurriculars and tackling each challenge with a determined attitude.

In endurance racing, the difference between winning and losing lies in strategy. But without real-time data, we were driving blind. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve poured countless hours into leading a team of 12 within my school‚Äôs Electric Vehicle Club. Driven by my firsthand experience with driver communication issues, I identified our weakness in strategy and founded a new club sector. Our goal was to develop a system to monitor and transmit our car‚Äôs telemetry data, enabling us to optimize our driving tactics for endurance racing. I led my team to design custom PCBs, integrate our software and hardware, and secure $1000 in sponsor funding. Years of iterating on our project led to success: our first ever team win at UW‚Äôs EV Challenge. In leading this team, I overcame the challenges that accompany team leadership and realized the potential impact I could have through building community.

I would have never expected my ethics to be put to the test while mountain biking. During a break at the bottom of the trail, I noticed a member of our group throw the wrapper of his protein bar into the bush next to him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not planning on leaving that there, right?‚Äù I instinctively asked. To my surprise, he and his buddies just shrugged it off and laughed. I felt humiliated. Deep down, though, I knew I had no reason to be ashamed. Each time I volunteered to maintain these trails, I witnessed the destructive effect of littering on both the forest ecosystem and the trails. I picked up his wrapper and took it home, still feeling a little defeated. Now looking back, I know I should have not hesitated to be more assertive. I‚Äôve learned to recognize the importance of not only doing what is right but also displaying confidence and standing firm in challenging situations.

At Waterloo, I will continue to pursue my goal of becoming a hardware engineer by blending academic learning with practical experience. UW‚Äôs unique approach will fuse together and amplify the skills I‚Äôve gained and demonstrated through EV club leadership, retail sales, and community volunteering. The UW co-op program in particular will be a catalyst for the industry application of these traits. In discussing education options with my parents and educators, I acknowledged my fascination with sciences and the world that surrounds me. However, I ultimately came to the conclusion that my genuine fulfillment came through not just studying science, but leveraging it to create truly innovative solutions. Computer engineering at UW enables me to achieve this by providing me with endless opportunities for collaboration, research and global networking, each of which I aim to make the most of.

At age eleven, I developed a curiosity for technology that grew into a strong desire to create and innovate. Due to this, I strived to attain a software engineering job before graduating high school. After countless interviews and rejections from reputable institutions, I finally accepted an offer from Sera4 to work as a Software Engineering Intern. During phases of rejection, I learned that failure doesn‚Äôt demotivate me; it does the contrary. The hardships I faced while learning have made me resilient to failure; failure has become the fuel I use on my way to success. At UW, I strive to learn every day, whether it be a new operating system or quirks of a programming language. I will also share my knowledge with everyone because the more you share, the more you grow.

During high school, as an Indian student in a primarily white neighborhood, I faced racial discrimination. Throughout grade ten I was ridiculed for my culture, with my food being labeled as "smelly" and things being vandalized. I watched as my "friends" would bystand the bullying unravel before them to avoid unnecessary conflict. The situation eventually escalated into physical bullying, in and outside of school. Eventually, being put in a two versus one situation, I ended up unconscious after a headlock. Looking back, I have gained compassion for those going through similar situations and learnt the importance of addressing conflict through peaceful yet constructive channels, such as involving school authority earlier, while standing up for those who have been wronged. This experience shaped my resilience and approach to challenges.

My goal is to advance my expertise in software development while also building lasting connections with industry members. I am particularly interested in the university's co-op program, which provides me with an opportunity to refine my skills and gain valuable work experience. I have some work experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Sera4. I have worked on integrating back-end systems with front-end applications while optimizing operations and implementing new features. I have also participated at hackathons, earning awards such as 'Best High School Hack' at Clock Hacks and 2nd place at the Neo Dev League. I have received valuable advice from my uncle, who emphasized the importance of self-directed learning. Keeping that in mind, my alternative path to achieving my goal is to learn independently and acquire knowledge daily.

13 years ago, I joined Club Warriors to learn how to swim. Since then, swimming has been a central part of my life. Through swimming, I've learned that competitiveness and curiosity drive me to excellence. I'm always looking for ways to improve my technique, such as how I can whip my legs around faster in breaststroke, or to be faster coming off the dive. Through a combination of my competitiveness and passion for learning, I have been steadily improving, and now regularly compete against Olympic athletes.
My curiosity extends beyond swimming into other interests, such as algorithms, robotics, and entrepreneurship. Through courses like Algorithmic Toolbox by UCSD and CS50 by Harvard, I‚Äôve turned my curiosity into valuable knowledge. At the University of Waterloo, a top school for entrepreneurship and research, my curiosity will enable me to succeed in problem solving and innovation.

I started the Neo Developer League (NeoDev), a non-profit organization, as an ambitious effort to revolutionize engineering competitions and create a community of young developers among high school students.

Leading a team of 10, I managed the organization, advertising, and fundraising for our first event, the WRDSB Summit. We brought together 100 students from 13 high schools to compete for a $1,000 prize pool at the Den 1880. While running this event, I realized the impact I had on high schoolers across Waterloo. Many students experienced their first competitive event through NeoDev, sparking their interest in problem solving and inspiring their curiosity in STEM.

High schools all across Ontario need exposure to the world of STEM and competition. It was exciting to see how Waterloo students benefited from our event and gained valuable experience in competitive engineering.
